settlers-dice-cards
===================

Settlers of Catan Event Cards replacement app written in Kivy

Background
----------

This is meant for use with the Settlers of Catan board game, which by default uses two dice but there was also a separate deck of cards which you could buy separately and use instead of dice to ensure a statistically perfect distribution, reducing the game's randomness and placing greater emphasis on strategy. It doesn't seem to be possible to buy the cards any more, hence the app.

Kivy
----

Kivy is a Python-based app development toolkit which supports Android, iOS and also desktop platforms for ease of development. I first heard of it at PyConUK 2012 and was interested to give it a try. (I've so far only run the app on my Linux desktop and within the Android launcher - it hasn't been packaged up yet)

Features
--------
* Hit the button to roll a pair of "dice"
* Sound effects for dice roll
* Accelerometer integration - roll on shake

TODO
----
* Settings screen (disable sound / accelerometer)
* Improve graphics - anti-aliasing and rounded corners would be nice
